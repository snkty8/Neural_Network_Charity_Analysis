# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview 

Using knowlegde of machine learning and neural networks, we will use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The provieded dataset is a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding over the years.  Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization. Using this data we will preprocess the data for a neural network model, complie, train, and evaluate the model, then optimize the model.
